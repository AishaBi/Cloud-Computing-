Cloud Computing (AWS) project

Tools used : AWS (Lambda, S3), Tweepy, Python script.

Within a 3 month time-frame, designed and developed an application to process real-time data and analytics of twitter's data stream. 
Used Twitter's API to collect the data and a word cloud model alongside a command-line interface to visualise the data. 
The application is cloud-based thus resulting in reduced infrastructure costs.
